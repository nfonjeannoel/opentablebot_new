I had the scallops and risotto for my main, my husband had the steak.  Both were cooked to perfection.  \nThe service was second to none!  I believe our server's name was Bart, and he looked after us like we were kings!  When it came time for dessert, we both thought we were full, but since it was my husband's birthday, we thought we would share a dessert.  We couldn't decide which one, so we asked Bart.  He simply said \"leave it with me\".  Much to our surprise, he returned a short time later with all 3 desserts beautifully presented on a charcuterie board!  But the biggest surprise was when we received the bill, we were not charged for the dessert!  Totally above and beyond our expectations!

We were there for almost 30 mins before we got our drinks and things just took forever.  I understand being understaffed and busy but we literally watched other tables be seated, order, get their food and pay before we got our main courses.  Only once was the delay even acknowledged when sever mentioned while walking by table and saying our meal was next but no real apologies were ever given. \n\n One of the meals was just not to standard (crispy chicken sandwich). Fries were cold and the chicken was over cooked and oozing grease so it soaked through to the bun. When complaint was made and asked for something else server just really stared at us as though it was a completely foreign concept and didn't even apologize or act as though she cared. It was just an annoyance. \n\nLittle things like offering to refill water, ask how food is, taking dirty dishes away, acknowledging requests made with more than a very slight nod would have really helped to avoid the building feeling of disappointment and frustration. \n\nThis was the first time the 3 of us have been out since the pandemic and splurged ($50 lunches are not our norm) and it was just really disappointing. \n\nI know how hard being a server is and would never harp on someone for doing their best but there are some basic tactics that can be taken to show your customers that they matter and are important. \n\nWe have all eaten there before and have always loved the food and never had issue with service. \n\nSide note!

I had a chowder with decently-sized chunks of yummy seafood. 'Partner had a club sandwich with more bacon than chicken--so, like, wasn't complaining. 5yo had a harder time (especially since we wanted them to have real dinner and not kids menu stuff) but still managed to eat some of the charcuterie board supplemented by my partner's fries. All in all, we had a really relaxed dinner where we felt part of the action but not overwhelmed with bustle. The kids wanted to go back for every meal!

We ordered the Larder Board to share for starter. I ordered the seafood pasta for my main course, and my wife ordered the stuffed chicken breast.\n\nThe Larder Board was a pleasant surprise. Certainly enough for two and a good selection of cheese, cured meats and pickles. The main courses, however, were less impressive.\n\nWhen the two plates arrived, the first thing my wife and I did was swap plates. The seafood pasta was pretty much as advertised, but the \"stuffed chicken breast\" was two pieces of chicken; a breast and wing, and a thigh and leg. Effectively half a chicken... and way more than my wife could ever eat.\n\nUnder the present circumstances not a bad evening out, but it could have been better.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": 3, "bestRating": 5, "worstRating": 3}}, {"@type": "Review", "author": "opentable dinner", "datePublished": "2021-01-16T18:24:25Z", "reviewBody": "Food is very good !

They were quite busy but luckily, they had space in their lounge area for our group. Our group was also late getting together so we didn\u2019t mind that we had to wait until almost 8:00pm to get our table. After sifting down, we had ordered a drinks, it took a little while to get our first round. Although, we were a large group (total 8 people showed up for dinner) we had ordered our food, some had appetizers before their mains but our mains took over an hour before it was served. A few of us ordered the \u2018special\u2019 of that evening, turns out there was only two \u2018left\u2019 and three of us ordered. Still, we waited quite a while to get our food. Finally, when the food came out, the food was PURE salt. I changed my \u2018special\u2019 which was a striploin into a tenderloin meal, added the side of shrimps and scallops and everything - the steak, shrimps and scallops was SO salty, it literally left a bitter aftertaste. This was common between everyone else\u2019s dish - just salty. Also, my steak was cooked to a medium instead of a medium rare but after waiting so long - just not worth it to complain. The cut of the tenderloin wasn\u2019t great either - pretty gritty. The restaurant \u2018normally\u2019 closes at 9:00pm but we were there until past 10:00pm so even when we were finished eating, none of our group wanted dessert but there wasn\u2019t an option for another round of drinks because they were already closed. The only person who had dessert was the one who complained about the saltiness of her lasagna and had the dessert as her main over getting any other main dish replacement. I\u2019ve dined here before a month prior for a business meeting and it was good, so I recommended it to my out of town friends since it was a special occasion for us to get together again after 10 years, but this experience was just a disappointment and the food expectation was terrible.

Fortunately, everything worked out very well and we had the upstairs area to ourselves which was perfect. For the main course, several people in our party had the pizza which looked delicious, while the rest of us enjoyed a variety of other different entrees. There was something for everyone on the menu at various price points, and all seemed happy with their meal and the portion size. Prices appeared to be very reasonable for the type and quality of food that was served. It was a great evening and I look forward to going back on a future trip to Halifax. Thank you to our servers for a job well done! (Note: the only hiccup was when I called to confirm my reservation on Friday for Saturday evening. The restaurant did not have record of it.
